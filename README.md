# GameOfCards-Drag&Drop
Final project of 1ÂºDAM course (development of multiplataform apps) which uses drag and drop for the cards with Java.

This app uses a database to work, it has features such as users creation, login, load of your own deck of cards, a shop to buy cards, money/coins system, and a gameplay part.
<br>
<h4>DISCLAIMER: This project got more work on the part of the cards deck, how they move, positions, etc.. than the gameplay.</h4>
